TorchDrug was initiated by [MilaGraph] to integrate recent advances in drug discovery and accelerate development,
with the vision of creating an easy access to drug discovery techniques for everyone. The library is designed for
machine learning practitioners to apply fundamental algorithms to drug discovery applications, with minimal efforts
on domain knowledge and trivial details.

For an introduction to drug discovery techniques, please refer to the [AAAI 2021 tutorial] on artificial intelligence for drug discovery.
